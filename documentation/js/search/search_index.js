 \n\nDelivery Much Challenge - Pokedex\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 11.0.4.\nDevelopment server\nNavigate to the cloned folder (containing the package.json file), and run npm install to install the project's dependencies. Then, run ng s -o to launch the dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component (inside the folder you wish to create a new component). You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module following the same process.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build. The environment files corresponding to both build scenarios are within folder environments.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nEnd-to-end tests will not be implemented for this project. The basic structure to implement them, however, will be in place.\nProject documentation.\nIn order to generate an overview documentation of the project, install \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2020 fernandonextlevel\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
